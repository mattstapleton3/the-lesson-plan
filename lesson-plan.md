## Lesson Plan — Internet Vernacular

### Introduction — Why should you care about meme language?

As we move into Week X of Generic Technical Communication Course, you all should be at least moderately familiar with the concept of **jargon**.

For those who might need a refresher on what **jargon** is, we refer to language used by technical professional communicating with one another as jargon. But not just any language can become jargon — this language is categorized by the lack of knowledge that someone outside of the field would have regarding what is being said, and how they could relate to it.

For those of you interested at all in technical communication on digital platforms following your entrance into the professional world, particularly if you plan to work in the social media branch of a company, memes will play a crucial role in your ability to engage with certain audiences. Some of you have certainly seem misconstrued social media campaigns that are labeled as "cringe," or perhaps you followed the Wendy's brand from the beginning of its Twitter dominance in the corporate environment. Regardless, you'll be expected to engage with the jargon of memes at some level in your environment.

Memes come in many forms, as most of you are probably aware — [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/) is one website that can keep you up to date with ongoing trends. If you are not active on any social media websites, it might be in your best interest to browse through some of the most recent memes that are "Trending."

### The Assignment Itself

For this week's discussion post, I would like to you all to create your own meme utilizing one of a number of possible formats. I'm not asking for a meme that's too complex or intricate — personally, I would recommend a "reaction image" or one with a fairly standard base with edited text, such as the one below. I would like you to include a 200-300 word description of your work.

In this example, you're able to see an ongoing trend of Plato's Bus, where people will "superimpose" text onto the image to create their own definition. The base image utilized here is available on the revelant [Know Your Meme page](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/two-guys-on-a-bus). 

### Completing the Assignment

There are a number of ways to create memes and gifs, typically through online websites. For arcane purposes, the main recommendation I would typically make — Photoshop — is not available for students through UCF. As a result, I will be recommending a number of alternative websites! Please see the list below for places to potentially make your own meme.
