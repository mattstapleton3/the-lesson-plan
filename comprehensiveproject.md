# Technical Writing: Colors Around the World

## Understanding Colors in Documents

With the international approach to technical writing, different cultural understandings of color play a significant role in modern document design. Colors feature heavily in documents that feature graphs and charts, or perhaps include warning symbols that readers will need to understand when they follow your directions. 

For you as a student, this means focusing somewhat on the perception of colors when designing documents. In this report, we will be looking at the most common color understandings divided by different relevant regions. These regions are intended to provide a broad overview of what colors will _most likely_ evoke in terms of emotional feelings for population centers. Even within different countries these rules are not hard and fast, but your goal as a technical writer is to appeal to the most broad range of readers as intended for your works.

## The List of Colors

This section will detail colors specifically, and the most common applications in the locations as mentioned previously. Please bear in mind that there are exceptions to the rule that will be covered in an embedded presentation at end of this lesson.

### Black

Black as a color is the most ambiguous across the world's cultures - it serves as a document's "default" for text and images, mostly due to the nature of print and digital media utilizing black writing on white pages. 

**Western Cultures**

As a color, black represents formality in Western cultures. However, it makes for a very poor graph color due to the inability to distinguish dividing lines. However, one might find that it can refer to "evil" within utilized pictures, but not for danger.

**Eastern Cultures**

In Eastern cultures, black is a color of positivity. In marketing documents, it is also one of "coolness," intended for a younger masculine audience.

**Latin American Cultures**
Black is representative of many of the same aspects in Eastern cultures as it is in Latin American ones. 

### White

In much the same way as black, white has been turned in a "generic" color due to its utilization in white paper and as the main text. However, white is beginning to take over black's role as "Dark Theme" becomes more accomodated in technology. White makes for an abysmal color to use in charts and graphs.

**Western Cultures**
White is representative of pure and good things, as well as being associated with snow and Christmas.

**Eastern Cultures**
White is representative of death and unhappiness.

**Latin American Cultures**
White represents peace, similarly to Western.

### Red

**Western Cultures**
Red serves as the "Danger" color, as well as representing blood or anger. Typically, you do not want to conflate it in your document with anything other than Danger.

**Eastern Cultures**
Red serves as the color of luck and happiness, making it a poor "Danger" color for signs that may not have readable texts in otehr languages than what the intended audience understands.

**Latin American Cultures**
Red represents passion, but shares many connotations with Western cultures due to proximity and similar use on road signs.

### Yellow

**Western Cultures**
Yellow is usually used as the "Caution" color to express a need for hesitation, but not outright "Danger" like red. However, yellow can also be used as an associated with sunlight in science graphing.

**Eastern Cultures**
Yellow serves as a mostly positive color in many countries, being used for promotional material. As a result, it serves poorly as the "Caution" symbol for intended audiences.

**Latin American Cultures**
In a different approach than Western cultures, yellow can still be used as the "Caution" symbol due to its association with death in such regions.

### Blue

**Western Cultures**
Blue is associated with trust and sadness in Western cultures, but also serves as a primary color.

**Eastern Cultures**
Blue is used primarily for health and medicine in Eastern countries due to its association with healing and religion.

**Latin American Cultures**
Blue indicates mourning in Latin American cultures.

### Purple

**Western Cultures**
Purple represents royalty and high-quality production.

**Eastern Cultures**
Purple represents royalty and high quality production as well.

**Latin American Cultures**
Purple does not have many associations in Latin American cultures, meaning it can be used as a neutral color.

### Green

**Western Cultures**
Green means "positive" or "good" in Western cultures, with an association with green stoplight colors also meaning it is safe to proceed. It is also used heavily in environmental campaigning as well as recycling.

**Eastern Cultures**
Green mostly represents nature in a neutral state, allowing it to function well as a neutral color.

**Latin American Cultures**
Green is found on a majority of Latin American flags, meaning that it has many associations with patriotism in these countries (like the combination of Red, White, and Blue in the United States.)

### Orange

**Western Cultures**
Orange is often used interchangably with yellow with regards to a "Caution" sign, and also has association with hazardous materials. However, it can also be used in advertising to represent something as "affordable."

**Eastern Cultures**
Due to the presence of Buddhism in many Asian countries, orange is often associated with religious imagery (good and bad) in these regions.

**Latin American Cultures**
Orange is the color of nature in Latin American cultures, meaning that it can be used as a neutral color. However, it is also used in advertising campaigns that focus on the environment.
